    <h1 id="title">What is ROBLOX?</h1>
<h2 id="info_title">Basic information</h2>
<p id="info">Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox also has a currency called "robux". Click <a href="#TheAvatarEditorTitle">here</a> to learn more.<br>

<h2 id="RBXLadminsTitle"><br><br>ROBLOX admins</h2>
<p id="RBXLadminsInfo"> Roblox admins are people who have power of the commoners of RBX.
Admin's have different powers than each other because they have different ranks for their account. Like, the ROBLOX account David.Bazucki, created by the owner of ROBLOX, David Bazucki, is ranked "owner" meaning he has the power to warn, ban, terminate etc. The account  "Telamon", originally called "Shedletsky", is ranked "Super HD A" meaning he cannot remove an item from someone's inventory etc. but can do everything else.
 It is also possible that an admin can be banned for doing bad things, such as "Luckymaxer" who put a script in every game to get anything you want using the <a href="#WhateGettitle">/e get function</a>, which, of course, is violating Roblox's TOS(terms of service).<br><br></p>
 <h2 id="TheAvatarEditorTitle">The avatar editor</h2>
 <p id="TheAvatarEditorInfo">The avatar editor is the place where any robloxian goes to edit there avatar. Roblox has different items that you can wear to look cool, dress up for a roblox occassion, or just to wear things. Some things in the avatar editor cost money which is why roblox has a currency called robux. Robux is what Robloxians use to buy things from  the avatar editor. Once you have bought something from the avatar editor, you can then wear it in your closet.<br> </p>

          <h2 id="WhateGettitle">What was /e get?</h2>
          <p id="WhateGetinfo">
              /e get was a virus function created by Roblox admin Luckymaxer. Of course, the virus is fixed, and the admin was fired, but for the full story, scroll down!<br>
               <br>
               Luckymaxer was a Roblox admin who worked on the coding of Roblox, as well as reporting bugs to higher ranked admins. That was until he found a bug and wanted to wreak havoc on Roblox using it. Luckymaxer found the glitch by accident as he was only trying to report more glitches to Roblox. Once he had found it, he really wanted to use it so he kept the glitch away from Roblox. The problem was that he had no way to get it into a game. He had to upload the function into a Roblox item in the avatar editor. Luckmaxer's choice was the <a href="https://web.roblox.com/catalog/4907423170/Stylish-Bunny-Ears">stylish bunny ears</a>. So, if someone wore the stylish bunny ears, they could use /e get then enter anything you want. This meant that if you were in any Roblox game, you could get anything you want. Now luckmaxer and the people he trusted were basically invincible. But there was one tiny flaw. Since the function wasn't actually part of the stylish bunny ears, if you had random people pressing F9 in a game, then they could see errors pop up that were coming from the Bunny Ears. Someone reported the errors to Roblox and David Bazucki saw that Luckymaxer was in the game when the person had reported the errors. He also saw that he was the only person with the Bunny Ears on. So, Luckymaxer was getting calls from Roblox asking him to talk. He finally fessed up after being fed up by hundreds of calls a day. By now, Luckymaxer was banned from Roblox and the glitch was fixed. Roblox did unban him, but they asked him to change his name.
